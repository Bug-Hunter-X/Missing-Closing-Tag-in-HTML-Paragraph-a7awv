# Missing Closing Tag in HTML Paragraph

This repository demonstrates a common HTML error: a missing closing tag.  The `bug.html` file shows the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.html` file demonstrates the correct way to write the HTML.

This error can lead to unpredictable rendering, with content sometimes flowing into unexpected places. Properly closing tags ensures the HTML structure is well-formed, leading to consistent rendering.

**How to reproduce:**

1. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
2. Observe the unexpected rendering of paragraphs.
3. Open `bugSolution.html`. Notice the corrected code and expected rendering.
